 #Tank Tech descriptions
 SOV_gw_tank_equipment:0 "T-18 (MS-1)"
 SOV_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "The T-18 (also called MS-1) was the first Soviet-designed tank. Produced from 1928 to 1931, it was based on the Renault FT, with the addition of a vertically sprung suspension.\nThe T-18 and its derivatives were essentially unsuccessful designs, but they gave Soviet industry its first experiences in designing armoured vehicles, and in the meantime a number of foreign tank designs were available for production."
 SOV_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The T-26 tank was a Soviet light infantry tank used during many conflicts of the Interwar period and in World War II. It was a development of the British Vickers 6-Ton tank and was one of the most successful tank designs of the 1930s until its light armour became vulnerable to newer anti-tank guns. It was produced in greater numbers than any other tank of the period, with more than 11,000 units manufactured."
 SOV_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The BT-7 (Bystrochodnij Tankov or 'Fast Tank' type 7) was derived from the 1930 American-built Christie tank, which had been perfected and modified into the BT-2 and BT-5 series.\nThey were pure cavalry tanks, designed for speed, with good armament but weak armor. Between 2700-5000 of these were manufactured between 1935-1940, when production ceased in favor of successor T-34 medium tank."
 SOV_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "T-60 Light tank was a result of earlier program to improve performance of already outdated light tank arsenal of USSR, and deal with general lack of tanks during early stages of war, when T-34 production was still having problems.\nThe tank was hardly an improvement, and it was hated. As a result of its poor armor, substandard armament and sluggish performance, it was more dangerous to its crews than anybody else, earning it the title Bratskaya Mogila na Dovoikh, literally: 'A brother’s grave for two.'"
 SOV_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_short:0 "SU-5-1"
 SOV_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_1:0 "SU-5-1"
 SOV_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "SU-5-1 was a prototype of a self-propelled gun mounted on a T-26 chassis, armed with 76.2 mm gun."
 SOV_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_short:0 "SU-57"
 SOV_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_2:0 "SU-57 (T48)"
 SOV_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "The SU-57, or T48, was the only American or British vehicle to be used in combat solely by the Soviets. Being American half-track, armed with 57 mm M1 anti-tank gun, the vehicle would take up a hull-down position behind a berm or ridge, with just the gun exposed. They would often be used as a supporting, second line vehicle making use of the 6-Pounders excellent mid to long range performance."
 SOV_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "The ZiS-30 was a light self-propelled anti-tank gun built for the Soviet Red Army in 1941. It was based on the Komsomolets armoured artillery tractor. They were successful vehicles, but production was limited by the number of Komsomolets tractors still in use."
 SOV_light_tank_artillery_equipment_1_short:0 "SU-5-2"
 SOV_light_tank_artillery_equipment_1:0 "SU-5-2"
 SOV_light_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "SU-5-2 was a 122 mm self-propelled gun on T-26 chassis. A limited series of 10 vehicles has been produced. Production ceased in 1937 with the termination of the 'Little Triplex' Program. Vehicle saw limited use during conflict with Japan in 1938, and during occupation of eastern Poland in 1939."
 SOV_light_tank_artillery_equipment_2_short:0 "BT-7A"
 SOV_light_tank_artillery_equipment_2:0 "BT-7A"
 SOV_light_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "BT-7A was an artillery support version armed with a short 76.2 mm Howitzer. 155 of these were produced. Some had the howitzer replaced with the longer 76.2 mm/31.5 caliber F-32 gun, testing that weapon before its implementation on the KV-1 heavy tank."
 SOV_light_tank_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "SU-76 was made out of a lengthened T-70 chassis (with an extra roadwheel pair). A 76.2 mm ZiS-3sh was placed at the rear, protected by an enclosed 10-35 mm thick sloped armored casemate. Later, an upgraded SU-76M entered production, with improved engine reliablity.\nUp to 13900 vehicles of various variants were produced between 1943 and 1945, mostly by GAZ plant."
 SOV_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "A-20"
 SOV_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "A-20"
 SOV_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "An evolution of the BT-series, A-20 and A-32 were prototypes used for testing new designs. During the Spanish Civil war, the soviet tanks were superior to those of Germany and Italy, however, it also became painfully obvious that the armor of the Soviet vehicles was simply not sufficient to protect the crew from the anti-tank weapons of the time. A new vehicle was ordered for developement, but only few were produced and it has been ultimately replaced by T-34."
 SOV_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Perhaps the most famous Soviet tank of WW 2, the T-34 possessed an unprecedented combination of firepower, mobility, protection and ruggedness.\nIts 76.2 mm (3 in) high-velocity tank gun provided a substantial increase in firepower over any of its contemporaries, while its well-sloped armour was difficult to penetrate by most contemporary anti-tank weapons."
 SOV_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "T-44 medium tank was supposed to become successor to the T-34 tank, with improved armor layout and chassis, mounting 85 mm gun. However, with an introduction of T-34-85, it has lost some advantages it had and since developing and producing a new vehicle would slow down overall production of tanks – something the Red Army could hardly afford, it was never mass-produced. Later attempts to improve the armament led to a new, completely redesigned T-54 tank."
 SOV_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The SU-122 (from Samokhodnaya Ustanovka 122 mm) was a Soviet self-propelled howitzer or assault gun used during World War II. The number '122' in the designation represents the caliber of the main armament—a 122 mm M-30S howitzer. The chassis was that of the T-34."
 SOV_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "Built on the T-34 chassis, and armed with a scarce, but powerful D-5T high velocity antitank gun, SU-85 was called “Samokhodnaya Ustanovka” or “SU” (self-propelled carriage). The SU-85 was in fact a provisional measure, being provided in a hurry in large quantities, to counter new Panther tanks, before larger quantities of T-34-85 could be produced."
 SOV_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "Closely related to the SU-85, the SU-100 incorporated much of its design, revolving around the new D10 100 mm (3.94 in) antitank gun. The SU-100 was built at the Ural Heavy Machinery Factory (Uralmash), with a thicker frontal glacis, which rose to 75 mm, among other improvements.\nIt participated in the final offensive on Germany and Berlin, and in the Romanian/Hungarian offensive."
 SOV_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The T-35 was a Soviet multi-turreted heavy tank of the interwar period and early Second World War that saw limited production and service with the Red Army. Often called a land battleship, it was the only five-turreted heavy tank in the world to reach production, but proved to be slow and mechanically unreliable. Most of the T-35 tanks still operational at the time of Operation Barbarossa were lost due to mechanical failure rather than enemy action."
 SOV_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Kliment Voroshilov - The KV tanks were known for their heavy armour protection during the early stages of the war, especially during the first year of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In certain situations, even a single KV-1 or KV-2 supported by infantry could halt large German formations. The German Wehrmacht at that time rarely deployed its tanks against KVs, as their own armament was too poor to deal with the 'Russischer Koloss'"
 SOV_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Successor to the KV-series, The IS acronym is the anglicized initialism of Joseph Stalin. IS and later IS-2 tanks were designed with thick armor to counter the infamous German 8,8 cm KwK guns and carried a massive 122mm main gun capable of defeating Tiger I and Panther tanks. They were mainly designed as breakthrough tanks, firing a heavy high-explosive shell that was useful against entrenchments and bunkers."
 SOV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "The SU-14 was a prototype Soviet heavy self-propelled gun built on a T-35 chassis. The original prototype mounted a 203 mm howitzer M1931 (B-4); the SU-14-1 variant of 1936 carried a 152 mm gun M1935 (Br-2) which could fire 48.9 kilogram shells at ranges up to 25 km."
 SOV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "A heavy assault tank armed with the M-10 152 mm howitzer, nicknamed 'Dreadnought', the KV-2 was produced at the same time as the KV-1. In the opening years of WWII, when the KV-2 operated in large numbers, it was virtually invulnerable to direct fire from all but high velocity weapons at horrifically close-range."
 SOV_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "The ISU-152 was an absolute nightmare for the Wehrmacht. Much like the SU-152, armed with 152 mm ML-20S howitzer, it was capable of blowing Tiger, Ferdinand, and Panther turrets/casemates open. However, what made the ISU-152 inherently better than the SU-152 was its superior armor and towing power. It had three major roles – assault gun, tank destroyer and mobile artillery, which made it one of the most versatile heavy vehicles of the war."
 SOV_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "SMK - A multi-turreted tank, similar to the T-35A and T-100 tanks. Only 1 prototype has been produced, and together with one T-100 tank and one prototype KV tank they participated in the Russo-Finnish war in 1939. The tank weighted 55 tons, had 2 main turrets - one armed with 76.2 mm L-11 gun, the other with a smaller 45 mm gun and had a crew of 7."
 SOV_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "Intended to fill the role of mobile heavy artillery support - The 'Zveroboy', or 'beast-killer', as it was popularly known in 1945, was certainly not intended as a tank-hunter. In practice, it was discovered that the 152 mm ML-20 howitzer, even if it could not penetrate the armor of enemy tanks, the excessive shock of the explosion on impact was enough to jam a turret, gun mantlet, blast tracks, kill the crew, or do other significant damage."
 SOV_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "The ISU-122 was a heavy self-propelled gun, and de facto a tank destroyer. The vehicle came to be because the Soviets were able to produce ISU-152 hulls faster than they could produce their 152 mm (6 in) ML-20S armament. Not wanting to slow down heavy tank production, A surplus of 122 mm A-19 guns started being mounted into ISU chassis. ISU-122 was used more as a tank destroyer, because its 122 mm gun was much more accurate than the 152 mm howitzer."
 SOV_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The IS-7, also known as the Object 260, is a Soviet Super-heavy tank that began development in 1945. The vehicle existed only in prototype form.\nWeighing 68 tonnes, thickly armoured, with a 'pike' shaped hull, it could withstand even a direct hit from a 12,8 cm Pak 44. Armed with a 130 mm S-70 long-barrelled gun, it was the largest and heaviest member of the IS family and one of the most advanced heavy tank designs."
 SOV_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc:1 "A modern post-war tank, featuring greatly improved armor, equipment, superior 100 mm gun, and a new V-54 diesel engine. After the large-scale production started in 1947, The T-54/55 series eventually became the most-produced tank in military history.  A staggering 83,500 were produced, alongside the Polish and Czech versions (21,000 more). China copied the design and started the production as Type 59."
