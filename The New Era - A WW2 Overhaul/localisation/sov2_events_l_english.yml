 soviet2.1.t:0 "Koshkin drives his tank to Moscow"
 soviet2.1.d:0 "Mikhail Koshkin, chief of tank design bureau in Kharkiv, has objected before against the A-20 tank, instead proposing his own A-32 (T-34 prototype). It has been rejected before already, but despite this, Koshkin continued developing his A-32 during evenings in his free time, after working on the A-20. Today, he arrived in Moscow, personally driving the tank over 800 miles, to prove its capabilities and reliability. The tank lacked any extra equipment, including heating. Koshkin died on 26th September 1940, from pneumonia he contracted during winter testing."
 soviet2.1.a:0 "Accept the T-34 into service."
 soviet2.1.b:0 "Reject the proposal."
 soviet2.2.t:0 "Stalin is disappointed"
 soviet2.2.d:0 "After reviewing various reports regarding performance of the Red Army during the last war, Stalin has voiced his disappointment with the army leadership. Losses greatly exceeded expectations, progress was slow, despite expected numerical and technical superiority, and lot of expensive military equipment has been lost to simple breakdowns or even captured by the enemy! Stalin ordered immediate revision of present practices and tasked general staff with reevaluating the current strength of the Red Army, as well as secretly ordering trials of those believed to be responsible."
 soviet2.2.a:0 "It will be done!"
 soviet2.3.t:0 "Reports from the Front"
 soviet2.3.d:0 "Incoming reports from the front are not as great as expected, in fact it includes a worrying amount of humiliating failures! Reports of failed offensives, abandoned posts, low morale and a growing number of casualties suggest it is only a question of time, before someone in the upper leadership is held responsible.\nAs a result, soviet generals are starting to see that things need to change, and quickly."
 soviet2.3.a:0 "We have to adapt."
 #soviet2.5.t:0 "Anti-German sentiments in USSR growing!"
 #soviet2_antifascist.d:0 "Ever since the fascists took control of the Weimar Republic in 1933, they have relentlessly pursued and persecuted any opposition, including the local communist-party. Germany's claims about their racial superiority, and hostile rhetoric towards the USSR has triggered a strong anti-german reaction.\nSoviet leader Stalin has denounced Hitler as a madman and his nazi regime as the ultimate enemy of all workers around the world. While both sides try to demonize the other, abort trade deals and treaties, tension between the countries is rising quickly."
 #soviet2_antikaiser.d:0 "Fuck Kaiser"
 #soviet2_antidemocracy.d:0 "Fuck democracy"
 #soviet2.5.a:0 "Will they stop at words?"
 soviet2.8.t:0 "Leon Trotsky assumes leadership of USSR"
 soviet2.8.d:0 "Yesterday, Leon Trotsky has been appointed the General Secretary of the Soviet Union, after a successful coup led by a group of high ranking pro-Trotsky party officials, who took control of the military.\n\nWhile the whereabouts of Stalin remain unclear, the world wonders - where will Trotsky, a staunch revolutionary, lead his country?"
 soviet2.8.a:0 "OK."
 soviet2.9.t:0 "End of Konev's coup"
 soviet2.9.d:0 "Konev's attempt to stop the revolution has failed, and he has reportedly commited suicide, just before our loyal comrades stormed his base of operations.\n\nThe devastation his uprising has caused to local regions is considerable however, and people were not happy about the bloodshed and tanks roaring around.\nWe will rebuild however, these are nothing more than steps towards greater good of our people!"
 soviet2.9.a:0 "OK."
 soviet2.10.t:0 "Decentralization of USSR"
 soviet2.10.d:0 "By the order of the General Secretary Trotsky, and with the approval from the Council of the High Soviets, several autonomous Soviet Republics are to be established. Each will elect a new governor, directly responsible to the All-Union Communist party. These measures should further ease the tensions inside the Soviet Union, reduce bureaucratic workload and improve executive efficiency."
 soviet2.10.a:0 "Keep them under control!"
 soviet2.10.b:0 "Give them more autonomy."
 sovietaltdesctrotsky.d:0 "Although countless people have been executed and imprisoned as traitors and counterrevolutionaries over the past years, leading positions have been largely safe. There is now a power struggle ongoing in the highest ranks of All-Union party and situation is very dangerous and unstable. The most pressing question is how will the army leadership react to the situation?"
 #For other countries
 #Continuation War
 ContWar.1.t:0 "Finnish Participation"
 ContWar.1.d:0 "Our general staff has suggested Finland could become a viable ally in our effort to tear down the Soviet Union. Their country's location and bases close to Leningrad, as well as the important Karelian Railway leading to Murmansk, would be invaluable to our planned eastern campaign. It is expected they may be willing to cooperate, as their relations with the USSR recently hit an all-time low.\nShall we proceed?"
 ContWar.1.a:0 "Yes, begin the negotiations."
 ContWar.1.b:0 "We don't need their help."
 ContWar.2.t:0 "Germany plans to attack the USSR"
 ContWar2_hadwar.d:0 "Today, a german diplomatic attaché secretly arrived in our capitol with a worrying, but interesting proposal: It seems Hitler plans to violate the Molotov-Ribbetrop pact, with possible invasion into soviet territiries. They would like to coordinate the attacks with our own forces. They would also like to use our airbases and later our territory as staging ground for direct attacks. In exchange guaranteeing return of our lost territory and control over Karelian peninsula. However, with the losses we suffered, we should ask for military supplies."
 ContWar2_nowar.d:0 "Today, a german diplomatic attaché secretly arrived in our capitol with a rather worrying proposal: It seems Hitler plans to violate the Molotov-Ribbetrop pact, with possible invasion into soviet territiries. They would like to coordinate the attacks with our own forces. They would also like to use our airbases and later our territory as staging ground for direct attacks. In exchange offering territorial gains and control over Karelian peninsula. However, this open support could go very wrong, and it's not guaranteed that any actual german help would arrive."
 ContWar.2.a:0 "Alright, but demand material help."
 ContWar.2.b:0 "No, it's too risky."
 ContWar.3.t:0 "Finland Agrees"
 ContWar.3.d:0 "Success! Finland has agreed to our terms. However, arguing their relative isolation and force disparity, they demand we sent them military equipment - weapons, artillery, and even airplanes! They also would like some support of their industry and exchange of army intelligence. We should have most of this in our warehouses. Our arrangement expects Finland to commence military operations about 2 months after our equipment arrives, and our forces attack."
 ContWar.3.a:0 "Send them all we can spare."
 ContWar.3.b:0 "Offer limited support."
 ContWar.4.t:0 "Finland refused"
 ContWar.4.d:0 "Our negotiations have failed, Finland doesn't seem interested in any furtger conflict with the Soviet Union. The spokesman said his government doesn't believe it could rely on our support, and generally in our ability to defeat the Soviet Union. All this probably out of fear of retribution from the Soviet side."
 ContWar.4.a:0 "What did he say??"
 ContWar.5.t:0 "German equipment has arrived"
 ContWar.5.d:0 "The promised german equipment has arrived, together with their military advisors. They have also supplied some of their factory machinery to help with our local arms production. The war seems inevitable now, we should begin preparations immediately.\n[The war will break out about 45 days after the Germans attack the Soviets]"
 ContWar.5.a:0 "Fine."
 ContWar.6.t:0 "German equipment has arrived"
 ContWar.6.d:0 "The promised german equipment has arrived, together with their military advisors. They have also supplied some of their factory machinery to help with our local arms production. The war seems inevitable now, we should begin preparations immediately.\n[The war will break out about 45 days after the Germans attack the Soviets]"
 ContWar.6.a:0 "Fine."
 ContWar.7.t:0 "Time to strike USSR"
 ContWar.7.d:0 "Time has come to begin our military operations against the USSR. Army command reports it is ready to commence operations in the Karelian Peninsula.\nAfter we enter the war, Germany has promised both direct and indirect support of our efforts."
 ContWar.7.a:0 "There won't be another opportunity"
 ContWar.8.t:0 "Finland attacks the Karelia"
 ContWar.8.d:0 "As per our secret arrangement, Finland has now officialy declared war on the Soviet Union! They cite loss of their historical territories and unprovoked Soviet Agression towards the finnish as their Casus Belli."
 ContWar.8.a:0 "Very good."
 ContWar.9.t:0 "We have been defeated"
 ContWar.9.d:0 "Defeat! The horror!\nOur country has fallen to enemy hands and our army disintegrated into various local militias. It's time to consider unconditional surrender, before it's too late and we'll loose any hope of remaining independent. Reprisals will most probably be harsh, but after all, both the Allies and the Soviets are still very busy dealing with the remaining Axis powers. Shall we contact the Soviet High Command?"
 ContWar.9.a:0 "It's Over. Do it."
 ContWar.9.b:0 "But the partisans and resistance!..."
 ContWar.10.t:0 "Armistice of Moscow"
 ContWar.10.d:0 "Finland has surrendered to us! Our diplomats have prepared the Peace Treaty, later to be known as Armistice of Moscow. Finland offers the transfer of the claimed states to us, and to renounce any further claims they have on us. Their army will be demobilised, they will expel any Axis forces and stop any further cooperation with Axis powers. They will also have to lift the ban on Communist Party and pay war reparations."
 ContWar.10.a:0 "Sign the treaty."
 ContWar.10.b:0 "Sign, but refuse their territory."
 ContWar.10.c:0 "I have other plans!"
 ContWar.20.t:0 "Finland at war again!"
 ContWar.20.d:0 "Hostilities have broken again between Finland and Soviet Union! Finnish soldiers have reportedly crossed the borders into Karelia and began an offensive into surrounding regions. There is a speculation that Germany might be involved, as the attack seemed all too well planned and coordinated with the recent breakout of war between Nazi Germany and the USSR."
 ContWar.20.a:0 "OK."
 ContWar.21.t:0 "Finland surrenders!"
 ContWar.21.d:0 "Diplomats from Finland have arrived in Moscow and signed an Armistice with the USSR and the United Kingdom, ending all further hostilities.\nThe Treaty forces the Finland to expel all Axis troops, give up some territory, pay reparations to Soviet Union and lift the ban on the communist party of Finland."
 ContWar.21.a:0 "Fine."
